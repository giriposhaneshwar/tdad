Offerings -> Value Added Services -> Research Products, Popup's to CMS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Front End/component view Modificaiton : 
- 	Append attribute "data-action='cms'" along with attribute "data-val" where ever you want to trigger 	article instead of component in popup. following is the example of dom element: 
	ex: <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="pop-like" data-action="cms" data-val="vas-investpop">
                                        <p class="ribbonBtn">View Investment Ideas</p>
                                    </a>
-	In Javascript file core.js at line: 1302 - 1364 i have implemented the popup to what to trigger 		component or article from joomla admin. I am pulling the data based on the url's.

Admin panel specifications : 
-	Create Article with the specif name, Category = "uncategoriesed".
-	Create invisible menu item with the name that match the DOM data-val attribute, so that the alias of 	 menu shuld match with attribute data-val's Value. so that the URL can be pointed based on the DOM 			value instead of article ID.
- 	Rest of the logic can be done by code.js script.
