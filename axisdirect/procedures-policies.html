                                Axis Securities Limited ("ASL") offers trading in most of the liquid stocks traded on the stock exchanges. Some of the stocks such as penny stocks i.e. stocks whose market price is less than their face value, scrips traded in physical mode or scrips which do not meet ASL’s internal criteria may not be allowed by ASL for trading. “Penny Stocks” also include, scrips having large bid-ask spreads, low market capitalization due to unsound fundamentals, “Z” category stocks or stocks, which have high chances of manipulations. Also, the Exchanges from time to time provide a list of securities categorized as” Illiquid Securities”. ASL may at its discretion or based on directives of the Exchanges may also restrict trading in illiquid securities from time to time. Any existing scrip enabled for trading may be deactivated by ASL as and when such scrips meet the criteria as defined by ASL for illiquid scrips, even if the Client had purchased the scrips through ASL. Further, ASL may also at any time, at its sole discretion as a risk containment or surveillance measure and without prior notice to the client, restrict client’s ability to trade in any specific security through ASL. Such restrictions could be only on buy or sell or both. Any losses if any on account of such restriction shall be borne by the client only. Further, ASL may from time to time require compulsory settlement / advance payment of expected settlement value/delivery of securities for settlement prior to acceptance /placement of order(s) which are larger than ASL’s internal limits. The client agrees that the losses, if any on account of such refusal or due to delay caused by such limits, shall be borne exclusively by the client alone.

                                <p class="procedure-main-hea">CLIENT’S EXPOSURE LIMITS: </p>
                                ASL from time to time may impose quantity and/or value limits on the orders that a client can place through its system (including exposure limits, turnover limits, limits as to the number, value and/or kind of securities in respect of which orders can be placed etc.). ASL may need to vary or reduce the limits or impose new limits urgently on the basis of risk perception and other factors considered relevant including but not limited to restrictions on limits on account of exchange/SEBI directions/limits (such as broker level/market level limits, security specific/volume specific exposures etc.). ASL may be unable to inform the client of such variation, reduction or imposition in advance. ASL shall not be responsible for consequences of such variation, reduction or imposition or the client’s inability to route any order through ASL on account of any such variation, reduction or imposition of limits. Such exposure limits may be set upto a predetermined number of times of the Margin (the "Multiple") and the quantum of the Multiple shall be decided at sole option or discretion of ASL. Such multiple may be changed at the discretion of ASL from client to client depending on various factors, which inter alia include factors like market conditions. Client shall abide by the exposure limits, if any, set by ASL or by the Exchange or Clearing Corporation or SEBI from time to time. The exposure limits set by ASL do not create any right in favour of the Client and are liable to be withdrawn at any time without notice and the client shall bear the loss on account of withdrawal of such limits. ASL may at any time, at its sole discretion and without prior notice, prohibit or restrict the client’s ability to place orders or trade in securities through ASL, or it may subject any order placed by the client to a review before its entry into the trading systems and may refuse to execute/allow execution of orders due to various factors including but not limited to the reason of lack of margin/securities or the order being outside the limits set by ASL/Exchange/SEBI and any other reasons which ASL may deem appropriate in the circumstances.
                                <p class="mt10">Limits/Exposure provided shall vary based on the intraday profit /loss made by the client. Exposure limits against collateral/stocks shall be given only against approved securities as decided by the Exchanges/ASL from time to time and subject to such haircut and valuations as may be decided by ASL from time to time.ASL from time to time may change the applicable haircut or apply a haircut higher than that specified by the Exchanges. In case of derivatives, Clients shall be allowed to trade only upto the applicable client wise position limits set by the Exchanges/Regulators from time to time.</p>
                                <p class="mt10">ASL from time to time may change the applicable haircut or apply a haircut higher than that specified by the Exchanges. In case of derivatives, clients shall be allowed to trade only upto the applicable client wise position limits set by the Exchanges/Regulators from time to time. ASL is entitled to include/appropriate any/all pay out of funds &/or securities towards margin/security without requiring specific authorizations for each payout. ASL is entitled to transfer funds &/or securities from client account for one exchange &/or one segment of the exchange to his/her/its account for another exchange &/or another segment of the same exchange whenever applicable and found necessary by ASL.</p>

                                Brokerage will be charged within the limits prescribed by SEBI / Exchange (currently 2.5%). Further, statutory levies shall be charged as applicable. Schedule of Brokerage currently applicable shall be as per Tariff sheet as below. The slab rate of brokerage shall be reviewed by ASL from time to time and may be changed in such manner as ASL may deem fit provided that the same would not contradict the regulatory provisions. ASL is entitled to charge brokerage within the limits imposed by exchange which at present is as under:

                                The client shall pay ASL settlement dues, brokerage, statutory levies and taxes etc. as are applicable from time to time. If the client fails to make payment of the amount due within the time frame specified by ASL, it shall be entitled to levy such charges by way of penalty or delayed payment charges not exceeding 18% per annum on amount due. This levy is only penal measure in case client defaults in meeting settlement and margin obligations and should not be construed as funding arrangement by the client and further the client cannot demand continuation of service on a permanent basis by citing this levy of delayed payment charges. Further, where ASL has to pay any fine or bear any punishment from any authority in connection with/a consequence of/in relation to any of the orders/trades/deals/actions of the client, the same shall be recovered from the client. ASL shall not be liable to make payment of any interest or delayed payment charges on the credit balance, if any, lying in the client’s ledger, margin account, deposit etc. with ASL. ASL may seek from the client to pay brokerage, all taxes, duties, levies imposed by any authority including but not limited to the stock exchanges, transaction expenses, incidental expenses such as postage, courier etc. as they apply from time to time to the client's account/transactions/services that the client avails from ASL.

                                ASL shall have the rights to square off the position of the Client (Including the right to refer the matter to arbitration) with no obligation of communicating the same to the Client, for non payment of margins or other amounts, including the pay in obligations, outstanding debts etc. and adjust the proceeds of such liquidation/close out, if any, against the clients liabilities/obligations.

On the days of market volatility or when there are system issues, ASL shall have the right to change/modify the timings of square off by either pre-poning or postponing the same.
